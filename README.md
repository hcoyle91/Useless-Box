Description:
	We are creating a box with two servos inside of it. When you flip a switch, it opens a hatch where a dragon comes out.the dragon hits the other switch making the knight come out. The knight hits both switches and makes both of them go back down except the knight goes back down slowly.
Your project's problem & goals
We want to create a box that when a switch is flipped, an arm comes out. We want to achieve each step on time and valid with the schedule. Our finish project needs to be reliable and well made. Well made means that all the tabs fit together and the servos are snappy.
Our problem is that the client asked us to make a box that turns itself off. Our solution to the problem is to create a servo arm or two. When a switch is flipped, the Arduino arms will go through a series of actions that will turn itself off.
A few problems that have occurred in past useless boxes is the access of the battery and servo arms not responding. Another problem we may encounter is the restriction of only 3D printing two items. We also have a limitation on time and space. A big problem we may run into is our knowledge. Our goal is to have the box work without the printed out dragon and knight.
