#### Description
	
We are creating a box with two servos inside of it. When you flip a switch, it opens a hatch where a dragon comes out.the dragon hits the other switch making the knight come out. The knight hits both switches and makes both of them go back down except the knight goes back down slowly.
We want to create a box that when a switch is flipped, an arm comes out. We want to achieve each step on time and valid with the schedule. Our finish project needs to be reliable and well made. Well made means that all the tabs fit together and the servos are snappy.
Our problem is that the client asked us to make a box that turns itself off. Our solution to the problem is to create a servo arm or two. When a switch is flipped, the Arduino arms will go through a series of actions that will turn itself off.
A few problems that have occurred in past useless boxes is the access of the battery and servo arms not responding. Another problem we may encounter is the restriction of only 3D printing two items. We also have a limitation on time and space. A big problem we may run into is our knowledge. Our goal is to have the box work without the printed out dragon and knight.

#### Criteria
* Two servos
* Three switches
* When you flip one switch it brings up the dragon
* When you flip another switch it brings up a knight
* The last switch turns on the box and brings power to the whole box(this switch will be put on the same wall as the LED and battery)
* An easily accessible battery pack
* Arms strong enough to flip the switch
#### Planned Materials Needed

* 6 acrylic sides
* 2 flaps
* 2 servos
* 1 Arduino
* An unknown amount of wires
* 2 hinges
* 2 switches
* Optional: Dragon and Knight
* 3d printed parts
* 2 Arms

#### Problems Encounterd:

* One problem we encountered was how to hold the servos. We had two servos that both needed to be close to the middle of the box and enough support. We wanted our servos’ center of rotation to be as close to the middle as possible so that the servos wouldn’t have to work harder to move the arms. The servos’ needed to be supported enough so that they could go through many rotations and not move out of their places. The servo holder also needed to bypass the Arduino. We made the servo holder go across and then down where it was screwed into the bottom.

* The second problem was that the battery pack in Solidworks was not the same one we had. The one we had was wider and shorter. All we had to do though was switch up the dimensions and print it.

* The third problem we encountered was that our switches were so stiff that our arms would fly off. We had two solutions to this problem. First, we took out a 3 or 4 springs from each switch. Second, we drilled screw holes into the arms and screwed them to the servo.
The third problem was that we needed to tape the battery to the wall because the hole was too big. It works but it is flimsy.

Lastly, We went over our planned schedule because we did not realize how long each part would take. Our arms took longer than we thought because cutting the servo horn hole needed to be manually dimension both times.
